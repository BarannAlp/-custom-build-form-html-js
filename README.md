# -custom-build-form-html-js
Startup Greece demo task
Hi, this project is developed for Startup Greece internship demo task.
I created a custom build form â€“ the user can add or remove fields at will. (The fields to be added or deleted are text & select).
When the user saves the data from the form, all the data is displayed in a table. The table has at the header the name of each field, 
for example Name of pet, and in the first row the speice of the pet, for example Lucy-Dog.
You can delete any row by checking the checkboxes of the rows and click delete button.
